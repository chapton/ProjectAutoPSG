# ProjectAutoPSG
Original package from https://github.com/skjerns/AutoSleepScorer with some modification for fitting KCMH dataset

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains all the files for training and preprocessing. It's more a file dump for me than a usable repository. Most files are absolutely undocumented.

I have created a small script that trains a model using the EDFx-database: `run_sample.py`.

## File description
